# cfiles
`cfiles` is a work in progress terminal file manager with vim like keybindings, written in C using the ncurses
library. It aims to provide an interface like [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) while being lightweight, fast and
minimal.

## Dependencies
- ncurses
- `cp`and `mv` for copying and moving
- `fzf` for searching
- `w3mimgdisplay` for image previews
- `xdg-open` for opening programs
- `vim` for renaming, bulk renaming and editing clipboard
- `mediainfo` for viewing media info and file sizes
- `sed` for removing a particular selection
- `atool` for archive previews

## Compiling and Installation
To compile, run

   `gcc cf.c -lncurses -o cf`

To install, simply move the generated executable to a directory that is in your `$PATH`

## Directories Used
`cfiles` uses `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cfiles` directory to store the clipboard file. This is used so that the clipboard
can be shared between multiple instances of `cfiles`. That's why I won't be adding tabs in `cfiles` because multiple
instances can be openend and managed by any terminal multiplexer or your window manager.
Note that this also means the selection list will persist even if all instances are closed.

`cfiles` also uses `$HOME/.local/share/Trash/files` as the Trash Directory, so make sure this directory exists before you try to delete a file.

For storing bookmarks, `cfiles` uses `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cfiles/bookmarks` file. Bookmarks are stored in the form `<key>:<path>`. You can either edit this file directly
or press `m` in `cfiles` to add new bookmarks.

`cfiles` looks for external scripts in the `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cfiles/scripts` directory. Make sure the scripts are executable before moving them to the scripts directory.

If `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is not set, then `$HOME/.cache` is used.

## Image Previews
`cfiles` uses `w3mimgdisplay` to generate imagepreviews. To setup imagepreviews, move the `displayimg` and `clearimg` scripts to wherever you like and the set the appropriate path in `config,h`.
You may have to modify the scripts a little, about which you can read [here](https://wiki.vifm.info/index.php/How_to_preview_images).

## Why C?
I wanted to improve my C and learn ncurses so I decided this would be an ideal project.

Apart from this, I have always wanted an alternative to ranger that is faster while still having
a similar UI.
